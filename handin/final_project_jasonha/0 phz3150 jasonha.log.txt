English sentence with correct syntax but incorrect tokens
"To*#day I gave my d@g a bath."
English sentence with correct tokens but incorrect syntax:
"He smiling when your fell."
The main feature of natural languages preventing their use as programming languages is their ambiguity. Natural languages at their core can change the meaning of what they communicate based on things like context and tones. Programming languages in contrast strive to convey the same meaning by removing that and being precise as possible.

homework 3
created a new directory called hw3_jasonha under handin
problem 1:
created a new local repository at C:\Users\jason\Desktop\phz3150, and initialized it with a readme.
published repository "practice" to personal Github account.
already downloaded github Desktop from before in class and set up repositories besides practice in class.
committing this log to the phz3150 repository (I'm not sure whether to use the phz3150 repository or my practice repository but both are on my computer)
I committed the file by uploading it and committing with the message 
"Added log to github revision control"
I made sure there is a backup on GitHub by adding this.
I just realized that I added the first repository incorrectly, I went back to create a new repository and selected the phz3150 folder as the repository, now I will committ it with no description.
After the initial commit I published this repository to github publicly with the commit message "Committed phz3150 directory as a repository"
I can now see all version historys of my log as I push the change to origin, so I took a screenshot of my phz3150 files in github showing that I have a backup and that the github code updates with newer versions of my log.
I took a screenshot of this as phz3150repositorygithub.jpg using windows snip
I made a new folder called test_git in my explorer but I couldn't find out how to put it under revision control before I added a file. After adding hw1-survey.txt from webcourses I committed the change to the local repository on Github Desktop, then pushed it to origin.

Created a new notebook called hw4_jasonha.ipynb at C:\Users\jason\Desktop\phz3150\handin\hw4_jasonha
saved and committed this to github
Completed Problem 2 in the notebook, I solved the problem by making numpy arrays so the math could be done using arrays.

Starting hw_5

Problem 1
I created a new folder called hw5_jasonha at C:\Users\jason\Desktop\phz3150\handin
In this folder I created a new juptyer notebook and saved it as hw5_jha.ipynb
After doing these two I committed this change using github desktop and pushed it to the origin.
I formatted the hw correctly so i can start the next problems and imported numpy.

Problem 2
I start by importing cmath a I was told I need the complex square root function.
I then define a function called Root1 with variables a b and c because the quadratic equation has two solutions
I was having trouble printing just Root1 but i realized i was trying to print a function and not call it. I use variables root1 and root2 for the math, then create a list that gets the values from root1 and root2 and returns them.
Problem 3
I was having trouble creating a function for problem 3
Problem 5
I had to finish the notebook and turn this homework in unfinished, I committed the changed notebook with the message"Finished on working on as much of hw5 as I could" to github desktop and pushed it to origin
I took a screenshot of it having been committed and saved it as "C:\Users\jason\Desktop\phz3150\handin\hw5_jasonha\hw5_finalcommit.jpg"

Starting HW6

Problem 1

Created a new directory called hw6_jasonha at "C:\Users\jason\Desktop\phz3150\handin\hw6_jasonha"
Windows wouldn't let me make a folder called HW6/ so I named the homework folder like I normally do.
Created a new jupyter notebook in that directory called hw6_jha.ipynb
Formatted the notebook with markdown comment containing name, assignment number, date, and "problem 2".
Saved the notebook, and committed the local change in github desktop. I then pushed this update to origin.
Commit summary was "Started problem 6 with new notebook and directory."

Problem 2

Imported numpy and pyplot
Created the array with step using np.arange, used 100.5 as the second number after printing and realizing i was missing an element with the value 100.
Found the function numpy.log10 to use for y
z was solved by using the operator ** to give x the exponent of 1/2
Created a plot with all the requirements listed until I was satisfied with how it looks.
Saved the plot as pdf called 'hw6_y(x)z(x)plot.pdf'

Problem 3
I remember how to make an array and print values in the array using conditions
At first I printed he elements of q that are larger than 50 and smaller than 70 using , to separate q[50<q] and q[q>70], but instead I found that you can use & to put two conditions in
I was able to turn the array into an list using .tolist()
I knew how to slice the list

I knew how to slice the list and to convert an array to a tuple using tuple()
I used if else statements to say its true or false that the letter e is in each element.
After completing the problem using functions I realize I should have shortened what I wrote using the map function.

Problem 4
I created a list of strings of the numbers
i need to figure out how to create a dictionary
I created a dictionary but I couldn't figure out what functions to use to return the value of the key.

Problem 5
I am zipping the file and committing the local changes and pushing them to origin.
I took a screenshot using snipping tool to prove I committed the changes and put a copy of this log in the folder.

HW6

Problem 1:
Created new folder called hw7_jasonha under handin folder
Created a new notebook called hw7_jha.ipynb under hw7_jasonha
Formatted the notebook with my name assignment number and date
Committed the local changes with the summary "Backup for hw7" and pushed to origin.

Problem 2:
I converted the sentence to a list of strings
I was able to use a for loop to print each word in the sentence
I also used a for loop to print the longest word by modeling it after the function we did in the demo and comparing the length of each string.
I was able to replicate the function in a while loop, but it prints the word developer which is the last word instead of the longest word.

I figured out why every iteration of n would print developer, my original code used sentence[word] when word isnt a parameter in a while loop. changing it to sentence[n] made it work properly.
I needed a new sentence with only the first 6 words, and searching online i found that concatenating strings was simple so i just concatenated them by assigning each word to a variable.
I then used a for loop inside of a for loop where the first loop iterates over each letter and sets flag = to 0 and the second compares letter i to every other letter by making it so if letter i is equal to letter j and that letter is not in the same position then flag is set to 1 and then letter i is only printed if its flag is equal to 0.

Problem 3:
working on the function circle in a notebook
i defined the function and for the math i used the equation of a circle and solved it for y, which gave me
y1=y0-((((-x0)**2) + (2*x0*x[i]) + (r**2) - (x[i]**2))**(1/2))
        y2=y0+((((-x0)**2) + (2*x0*x[i]) + (r**2) - (x[i]**2))**(1/2))
the reason for two functions is because the true answer is plus or minus the part under the radical, as a circle has two outputs for every x value.

i had to make arrays to hold y1 and y2 but i was able to finish the function and have it work.
importing the function from my ipynb file i made in jupyter gives me the error null is not defined which has never happened before, so i will instead load the functions in

Problem 4:
This one was more simple, given an array i had to compare one number to the others and switch their orders if the first was smaller. using two for loops the second loop compares the number to the number after it, and switches them if the one in front is smaller. the first for loop then does this for all numbers
Problem 6:
preparing homework and zipping and submitting. also pushing to origin in github and screenshotting.

Started working on midterm project
1. 
Created the directory Midterm_jasonha and moved the required files to that folder.
Imported numpy and matplotlib.pyplot

2.
created the necessary variables with a value of the input function
created list planets_and_moons
used an if, elif, else function to check if any or both inputs are incorrect and printed the required error message or else the valid locations message.
Ran the tests d-1 and d-2 and saved the screenshots using the windows snip tool
3.
I need to figure out which numpy function can put in this .dat file.
OUT***** Wed Mar 2 14:09:00 EST 2022

IN***** Wed Mar 2 19:48:00 EST 2022

3. 

I found the function numpy.loadtxt works best to create the array I wanted.
I used the .index function to make the variables equal to the index of where the strings are in the list
I was able to print an informative statement with these variables.
Using the rate = distance / time formula I calculated the time in hours using the given values.
I tried using the modulus function at first, but instead I leveraged the int function to calculate the years days hours and minutes without counting the smaller units from the total time it takes.
I was able to turn the function I wrote so far into a function called planet_tour. I saved this as a py file and imported it and called it for Earth and Mars.

4.

In a separate notebook where I work on the planet_tour function I was able to calculate the number of trips needed by dividing the distance by the distance it takes for fuel to run out.
I made an array using arange to get the distances a station needs to meet us at. Element 0 of the array represents the distance 0.65, which is where the first stop must take place.
I need to figure out how to write this to a text file, so far I've written with the open function but the last part of the message where we must tell the stations where to meet us is hard to write.

OUT***** Thu Mar 3 00:51:00 EST 2022

IN***** Thu Mar 3 10:31:EST 2022
4.
I figured out how to change the object type to write in the text file correctly.
5.I added the other two dates as arrays and used an if function to compare the values for each date to find the best date with least distance. I made the new print function and tested te changes.
6.
I was not able to finish problem 6 but I will make a screenshot and push it to the origin.

HW8
Problem 1:

Created the new folder hw8_jasonha in handin

Problem 2:

created notebook for main homework file
created new notebook to code the support function
wrote function using the formula and solving for a1(i know the instructions said use earth as p1 and a1 but theyre ratios so it works either way)
tested the function and then exported it as a py file
imported it into the notebook
divided each planet's period in days by 365.25 to get a variable for their period in earth years
ran the function for each of the planets
created two arrays with the true and calculated distances
created an array with numbers 1-7 to represent the 7 planets in order
plotted the points according to the directions

Problem 3:

created arrays x y and z
a) plotted y(x) and z(x) as directed and use plt functions to make it look like what was requested
b)I was able to scan arrays x y and z and print what was requested
c) made the 2d array of zeros with sizes len(x) and len(y)
d)I used the double for loop to populate those arrays
e) I couldn't figure out how to print the requested part from the x and y columns. I'm not sure if I mad the inital 2d array of zeros right.
f) i used np.transpose to do this
g) i wrote the code to make a publication ready plot with the right slices, but am getting the error that the length is not right. I may have messed up the data somewhere along the line.

Problem 4:
I began to call the function with the right variables. I am very confused as to what the function is supposed to do and how to get it to take an array of volumes and return an array as well.

Problem 5: I am out of time, so I am going to prepare and submit the homework. I am going to make a copy of this log into the handin and commit the finalized notebook and functions to github. Then I will zip the folder and submit it to webcourses.

Starting HW 9

Problem 1
Created directory hw9_jasonha in handin directory
Created hw8_jha jupyter notebook in hw9_jasonha
Committed these changes and pushed them to origin with a statement.

Problem 2

a)
imported numpy and created the two arrays
b)
to create the function it looks like we have to take the 1st 2nd and 3rd element of sports and do multiplication with their speeds to get their times for each event, add all 3 events together, and use that to get the total time. then compare all their times to get the fastest time and longest time, then use those times to get the id's of the participants and print the message using the id and time in hours. I was able to write that by setting intial values to compare together and a for loop to compare values and replace them if the fastest time happened to be faster than the current time held and vice versa with the slowest.
c) creating the dictionary was easy, i just redefined sports and athletes_times
d) transforming the original function into a dictionary function was easy, i just needed to refer to the same values as i did originally and iterated over key in athletes_times.
e) calling both functions showed that the result was the same, the same participants were the slowest and fastest.

Problem 3

a) I have to find a problem, most likely from my physics class, for now I'm moving to Problem 4 while I try to get inspiration

Problem 4

for all of the steps in problem 4 i can define the class based off the demo we went over in class, and any issues i come across ill just have to deal with.
I didn't end up having any issues, this problem was less troublesome all I had to do was properly refer to things with the subject followed by . and the function.
Now for the print statement, it keeps printing "None" after the print statements. The statements are right I just don't know where None is coming from.

4.
I figured out how to change the object type to write in the text file correctly.
5.I added the other two dates as arrays and used an if function to compare the values for each date to find the best date with least distance. I made the new print function and tested te changes.

HW8
Problem 1:

Created the new folder hw8_jasonha in handin

Problem 2:

created notebook for main homework file
created new notebook to code the support function
wrote function using the formula and solving for a1(i know the instructions said use earth as p1 and a1 but theyre ratios so it works either way)
tested the function and then exported it as a py file
imported it into the notebook
divided each planet's period in days by 365.25 to get a variable for their period in earth years
ran the function for each of the planets
created two arrays with the true and calculated distances
created an array with numbers 1-7 to represent the 7 planets in order
plotted the points according to the directions

Problem 3:

created arrays x y and z
a) plotted y(x) and z(x) as directed and use plt functions to make it look like what was requested
b)I was able to scan arrays x y and z and print what was requested
c) made the 2d array of zeros with sizes len(x) and len(y)
d)I used the double for loop to populate those arrays
e) I couldn't figure out how to print the requested part from the x and y columns. I'm not sure if I mad the inital 2d array of zeros right.
f) i used np.transpose to do this
g) i wrote the code to make a publication ready plot with the right slices, but am getting the error that the length is not right. I may have messed up the data somewhere along the line.

Problem 4:
I began to call the function with the right variables. I am very confused as to what the function is supposed to do and how to get it to take an array of volumes and return an array as well.

Starting HW 10

Problem 1
Created a new directory called hw10_jasonha under handin
Created a new python 3 notebook in that folder called hw10_jha.ipynb
I pushed commited these changes and pushed it to origin.

Problem 2

The python debugger identified all the errors, I just fixed them.
The first error with this program came in the fact that i and j were not integers in the for loop, so i changed them to l1 and l2 respectively.
Then I got an out of bounds error, I realized that was because python references arrays by row, column. L1 and L2 had the wrong values for their ranges 
Another error is that for the calculation of relative error creates a situation where you divide by zero ([1][0]my_control_data). To solve that I changed the value to 1 instead of 0 since it was as close as I could get to 0 (-1 doesn't change the end result either)
There was a syntax error with a missing = that I fixed.
n=n+1 was also not in the for loop, messing up the plot.

Problem 3

I started writing the function with an if and elif function to differentiate the strings, then wrote the formulas to calculate the values we wanted to print. the for loops were easy to code for these calculations. I used online calculators to check these values after I ran the code for the asked values to make sure the math was done properly.

Problem 4

I created the dictionary, and created the simple function period(a) to calculate the period. Using a for loop, I ran the function for each planet.
For the plot, I first plotted the parametric equation for one planet, then used a for loop to turn plot every planet in the dictionary. To make the graph look exactly like the instructions, in the for loop i use if and elif to determine if the planet was neptune or saturn which had different color lines in the image, and those would be plotted just with the specified colors. Finally, I used all the other matplotlib functions to make the graph the same and save it as a png.

I am turning in hw_10_fig.png for this problem

Problem 5

After finishing the problems I am going to make a copy of this log and upload this to github and push it to origin. I will screenshot that and save it as hw_10_commit.jpg and I will turn in that screenshot for this problem as well, then i will zip and upload the folder.

Problem 1

folder for hw11 was created in handin directory and was pushed to origin through github.
the jupyter notebook was started in the hw11 folder

Problem 2

After creating all the required arrays I began to make the code that determines the least square error like the demos in class, but I also included in the for loop code that determines if the current r square value is the smallest seen, and if it is the flags become the indices of the a and b value which it came from, so later we can pull back the a and b values to tell the user what the a and b values where that created the least square error.

Problem 3
a.
I just created the function as the directions gave using the same formula given.
b.
Same thing here, except with a for loop iterating through a dictionaries keys.
c.
I used and if else function to determine which list was the one containing an integer data type, whichever one did meant the other was strings so the else function performed the same code but with the list 1 and list 2 variables swapped. The code performed was a for loop which takes the keys of one list and the values of the other and puts them into a blank dictionary dict.
d.
this one took longer, but i first made a blank array with the same dimensions of one matrix, the if and else function determines whether or not the np.shape of the arrays are the same, if they are then a for loop does manual matrix multiplication, if they are not an informative statement is provided telling the user the shape of the two arrays.

Problem 4
I am finishing up the code and rechecking it, now I commit the notebook to github with the commit message "completed hw 11" and saved a screenshot from windows snipping tool as hw11_jha.png
submitting hw11_jha.png for this problem.
I'm not putting this log in, zipping the file, and submitting.

Starting Final Project
Downloaded all necessary files from canvas

Problem 1:
Opened the notebook to start it and I am working on the log.
Did my necessary imports and created the empty list

Problem 2:
For this problem I turned the given numbers into a list, and created the dictionary.
Using the list and dictionary, I created an empty list for the decoded message and iterated first over every number in the message list, then over each key to check if the value matched the current number from the message. If it did, then we append the key of that value and move on to the next number in the message.

Problem 3:
For this problem I used np.loadtxt to easily create an array, and used plt.contour to create the graph. I couldn't figure out a way to use the levels specified as that returned an error saying no contour levels were found within the data range. I appended the number 3 to the keycode list.

Problem 4:
For problem 4 I read in the data the same way, and used .invert_yaxis() to invert the y axis so the message could be read.

I couldn't figure out a way to use the levels specified as that returned an error saying no contour levels were found within the data range. I appended the number 3 to the keycode list. I decided to leave the warning in.

Problem 4:
For problem 4 I read in the data the same way, and used .invert_yaxis() to invert the y axis so the message could be read. I had to import io because of a encoding error with the dat file, otherwise i made the for loop split each sentence into its words as a string and checked if the word was 'muahaha', and created a laughcounter.

Problem 5:

Adapting my code, I printed just the last line using readlines() and afterwards used the same for loop to do counts for one two three and seven instead of muahaha.
After using the sum function to do sigma sums and plugging the numbers into the given equation i was given the number 7.93, which i rounded to 8 and appended.

Problem 6:

I read the data and made x1 y1 and z1 all slices of the array which are the columns.
I then plotted them in 3d space and noted it looks like a hurricane or tornado.

Problem 7:

I used google to find that the year it was painted is 1665.
I then used the built in numpy functions to find the mean, median, and trace. The trace matched, so u is 3.
In the second puzzle I used the given formula for the transit to solve for the radius of the planet.
For the wobbling I was not able to isolate the variable of mplanet
I know the planet is saturn, so that meant N is 6. The number N/u is 2, so i appended it to the key_code.

Problem 8:

The first bug I solved was that the variable radius 1 was defined twice so I fixed that.
The next was that the inputs had to be converted to floats.
Then I realized that the perimeter was supposed to be the equation for the circumference, so i multiplied both perimeter 1 and perimeter 2 by pi.
I read the announcement so I didn't remove time1 and time2
I converted the speed to an int value.
despite converting the speed to an int value the float object was not callable for some reason, so i had to import math to use the ceil function for that one, but at the end i was able to split it and append the numbers to the code.

Problem 9:

I converted the table into an array and made the variables gps time distance and error slices of that array.
I plotted the figure as asked with error bars.
I then created arrays for u a and u0 and created r square values to begin trying values in a least error squares for loop. I also used flags to tell me which index the current lowest r square value was found in.
Using two models I determined the acceleration model fit the data the best as the r squared value was lowest with that model. I then appended the value of the acceleration of the best fit model and added it to the keycode

Problem 10:

I loaded in the data using np.loadtxt.
I then plotted the data to see it visually so I could understand it better, after that I used a while loop to change the where i starts to 3, and used the if conditional to scan 3 values before it and 3 after to check for a peak, and then if a peak was found the peakcount would increase by 1.
I then appended the number of peaks to the keycode.

Problem 11:
The 8 digits I found for the keycode did not unlock the pdf, I will have to try and figure out which I might've done wrong. I still wasn't able to find what I did wrong.

Problem 12:
I didn't get the right code but I am fairly confident I solved the problems correctly. I am still going to prepare and submit this, finishing this zip and then committing the finalized log and pushing it to github. I will snip the github commit as well and submit that.
