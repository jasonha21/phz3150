Problem 2
English sentence with correct syntax but incorrect tokens
"To*#day I gave my d@g a bath."
English sentence with correct tokens but incorrect syntax:
"He smiling when your fell."
The main feature of natural languages preventing their use as programming languages is their ambiguity. Natural languages at their core can change the meaning of what they communicate based on things like context and tones. Programming languages in contrast strive to convey the same meaning by removing that and being precise as possible.

homework 3
created a new directory called hw3_jasonha under handin
problem 1:
created a new local repository at C:\Users\jason\Desktop\phz3150, and initialized it with a readme.
published repository "practice" to personal Github account.
already downloaded github Desktop from before in class and set up repositories besides practice in class.
committing this log to the phz3150 repository (I'm not sure whether to use the phz3150 repository or my practice repository but both are on my computer)
I committed the file by uploading it and committing with the message 
"Added log to github revision control"
I made sure there is a backup on GitHub by adding this.
I just realized that I added the first repository incorrectly, I went back to create a new repository and selected the phz3150 folder as the repository, now I will committ it with no description.
After the initial commit I published this repository to github publicly with the commit message "Committed phz3150 directory as a repository"
I can now see all version historys of my log as I push the change to origin, so I took a screenshot of my phz3150 files in github showing that I have a backup and that the github code updates with newer versions of my log.
I took a screenshot of this as phz3150repositorygithub.jpg using windows snip
I made a new folder called test_git in my explorer but I couldn't find out how to put it under revision control before I added a file. After adding hw1-survey.txt from webcourses I committed the change to the local repository on Github Desktop, then pushed it to origin.

Opened jupyter and created a new notebook at \Users\jason\Desktop\phz3150\handin\hw3_jasonha
Named the notebook hw3_jasonha_test_notebook, completed problem 3 in this notebook.
Finished Problem 3 and now working on Problem 4 to prepare files to submit.
Going back to Problem 1 to list all problems in order and what I will turn in.

Problem 1

I will paste all the problems and how I solved them in one entry. Submitting this log for that.

HW4
Problem 1
Created a new folder named hw4_jasonha at C:\Users\jason\Desktop\phz3150\handin
Created a new notebook called hw4_jasonha.ipynb at C:\Users\jason\Desktop\phz3150\handin\hw4_jasonha
saved and committed this to github
Completed Problem 2 in the notebook, I solved the problem by making numpy arrays so the math could be done using arrays.
created a new notebook called acceleration_function.ipynb for Problem 3
I wasnt able to figure out how to define the function acceleration for problem 3.

Starting hw_5

Problem 1
I created a new folder called hw5_jasonha at C:\Users\jason\Desktop\phz3150\handin
In this folder I created a new juptyer notebook and saved it as hw5_jha.ipynb
After doing these two I committed this change using github desktop and pushed it to the origin.
I formatted the hw correctly so i can start the next problems and imported numpy.

Problem 2
I start by importing cmath a I was told I need the complex square root function.
I then define a function called Root1 with variables a b and c because the quadratic equation has two solutions
I was having trouble printing just Root1 but i realized i was trying to print a function and not call it. I use variables root1 and root2 for the math, then create a list that gets the values from root1 and root2 and returns them.
Problem 3
I was having trouble creating a function for problem 3
Problem 5
I had to finish the notebook and turn this homework in unfinished, I committed the changed notebook with the message"Finished on working on as much of hw5 as I could" to github desktop and pushed it to origin
I took a screenshot of it having been committed and saved it as "C:\Users\jason\Desktop\phz3150\handin\hw5_jasonha\hw5_finalcommit.jpg"

Starting HW6

Problem 1

Created a new directory called hw6_jasonha at "C:\Users\jason\Desktop\phz3150\handin\hw6_jasonha"
Windows wouldn't let me make a folder called HW6/ so I named the homework folder like I normally do.
Created a new jupyter notebook in that directory called hw6_jha.ipynb
Formatted the notebook with markdown comment containing name, assignment number, date, and "problem 2".
Saved the notebook, and committed the local change in github desktop. I then pushed this update to origin.
Commit summary was "Started problem 6 with new notebook and directory."

Problem 2

Imported numpy and pyplot
Created the array with step using np.arange, used 100.5 as the second number after printing and realizing i was missing an element with the value 100.
Found the function numpy.log10 to use for y
z was solved by using the operator ** to give x the exponent of 1/2
Created a plot with all the requirements listed until I was satisfied with how it looks.
Saved the plot as pdf called 'hw6_y(x)z(x)plot.pdf'

Problem 3
I remember how to make an array and print values in the array using conditions
At first I printed he elements of q that are larger than 50 and smaller than 70 using , to separate q[50<q] and q[q>70], but instead I found that you can use & to put two conditions in
I was able to turn the array into an list using .tolist()
I knew how to slice the list

I was able to turn the array into an list using .tolist()
I knew how to slice the list and to convert an array to a tuple using tuple()
I used if else statements to say its true or false that the letter e is in each element.
After completing the problem using functions I realize I should have shortened what I wrote using the map function.

Problem 4
I created a list of strings of the numbers
i need to figure out how to create a dictionary
I created a dictionary but I couldn't figure out what functions to use to return the value of the key.

Problem 5
I am zipping the file and committing the local changes and pushing them to origin.
I took a screenshot using snipping tool to prove I committed the changes and put a copy of this log in the folder.

HW6

Problem 1:
Created new folder called hw7_jasonha under handin folder
Created a new notebook called hw7_jha.ipynb under hw7_jasonha
Formatted the notebook with my name assignment number and date
Committed the local changes with the summary "Backup for hw7" and pushed to origin.

Problem 2:
I converted the sentence to a list of strings
I was able to use a for loop to print each word in the sentence
I also used a for loop to print the longest word by modeling it after the function we did in the demo and comparing the length of each string.
I was able to replicate the function in a while loop, but it prints the word developer which is the last word instead of the longest word.
