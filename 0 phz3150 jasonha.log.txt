"To*#day I gave my d@g a bath."
English sentence with correct tokens but incorrect syntax:
"He smiling when your fell."
The main feature of natural languages preventing their use as programming languages is their ambiguity. Natural languages at their core can change the meaning of what they communicate based on things like context and tones. Programming languages in contrast strive to convey the same meaning by removing that and being precise as possible.

homework 3
created a new directory called hw3_jasonha under handin
problem 1:
created a new local repository at C:\Users\jason\Desktop\phz3150, and initialized it with a readme.
published repository "practice" to personal Github account.
already downloaded github Desktop from before in class and set up repositories besides practice in class.
committing this log to the phz3150 repository (I'm not sure whether to use the phz3150 repository or my practice repository but both are on my computer)
I committed the file by uploading it and committing with the message 
"Added log to github revision control"
I made sure there is a backup on GitHub by adding this.
I just realized that I added the first repository incorrectly, I went back to create a new repository and selected the phz3150 folder as the repository, now I will committ it with no description.
After the initial commit I published this repository to github publicly with the commit message "Committed phz3150 directory as a repository"
I can now see all version historys of my log as I push the change to origin, so I took a screenshot of my phz3150 files in github showing that I have a backup and that the github code updates with newer versions of my log.
I took a screenshot of this as phz3150repositorygithub.jpg using windows snip
I made a new folder called test_git in my explorer but I couldn't find out how to put it under revision control before I added a file. After adding hw1-survey.txt from webcourses I committed the change to the local repository on Github Desktop, then pushed it to origin.
